A professional, secure, and cloud-based Task Management application built during my Full-Stack Web Development internship. This project evolved from a simple UI to a fully secured backend system.

## 🚀 Project Evolution

### 🔹 Level 1: Frontend & Basic CRUD
- Developed a responsive User Interface using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Implemented core **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
- Managed tasks locally to ensure a smooth user experience.

### 🔹 Level 2: Database & Cloud Integration
- Integrated **Node.js** and **Express.js** to handle server-side logic.
- Connected the application to **MongoDB Atlas** for permanent cloud data storage.
- Deployed the backend live on **Render** to make the API accessible globally.



### 🔹 Level 3: Security & User Privacy (Advanced)
- **JWT Authentication:** Implemented secure Login/Signup using **JSON Web Tokens**.
- **Password Hashing:** Used **Bcrypt** to encrypt user passwords before saving them to the database.
- **Protected Routes:** Created custom middleware to restrict access to authenticated users only.
- **User-Specific Data:** Linked tasks to individual **User IDs**, ensuring users can only see and manage their own private tasks.
